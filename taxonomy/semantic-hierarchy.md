# Semantic Hierarchy

This document outlines the layered taxonomy for Humanficial terms, helping ensure clarity and conceptual consistency.

## Example Hierarchy

- SYSTEM → COS, HIOS, CoreCells
- FUNCTION → Flow Detector, Time Reclamation Plan
- CONCEPT → Symbiotic Loop, Compression Without Compromise
- STATUS → COS Live, LBD Activated, Blueprint Qualified

Each level of language exists in a nested structure. This allows recursive understanding and intelligent system integration.
