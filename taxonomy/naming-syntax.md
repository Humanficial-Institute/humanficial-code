# Naming Syntax Rules

This document defines how names are constructed within the Humanficial ecosystem.

- Use one-word nouns for core systems (e.g., COS, HIOS, CoreCells)
- Use metaphor-based tier names (e.g., Pioneer, Architect)
- Use verbs or compound verb-nouns for active functions (e.g., Flow Detector, Time Reclamation Plan)
- Lowercase for file and directory names, kebab-case for multiword files
- Humanficial names should never mimic legacy AI terminology (e.g., "agent", "bot") unless deliberately redefined

This is the structural logic behind our language.
