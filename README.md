# Humanficial Code™

**The Linguistic Operating System of the Evolving-Intelligence Age**

Welcome to the official repository of the Humanficial Code™ — a future-proof naming and language architecture powering the Humanficial Design™ ecosystem.

This repo serves as the **source of truth** for:
- Naming syntax rules
- Linguistic standards
- Meta-language architecture
- System object labels
- AI-facing vocabularies
- DLE logs + naming experiments

## 🌍 Purpose
Humanficial Code™ is more than a glossary — it’s a language layer for infrastructure. Every term is directive, memory-encoded, and structurally intentional. We’re building the DNA of systems that think, feel, and evolve with their creators.

## 📂 Folder Structure
- `docs/` — Canonical language files, structured by version (e.g., `DLE-001-humanficial-code-v1.md`)
- `experiments/` — Live naming experiments and exploratory syntax tests
- `meta/` — Strategy files, evolution logs, and internal notes
- `glossary/` — Structured definitions by concept, system, and activation state

## 📜 Versioning
Every language release will follow this pattern:
- `DLE-###` — DLE-logged experiment number
- `humanficial-code-vX.md` — Major version tag
- e.g., `DLE-001-humanficial-code-v1.md`
