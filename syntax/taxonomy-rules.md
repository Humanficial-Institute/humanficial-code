# Taxonomy Rules  
The principles that govern classification within the Humanficial Code™.

## Structure:
- Category → Subcategory → Function → Instance
- Examples:
  - Performer (category)
    - Blueprint Performer (subcategory)
      - Barack (function = model logic)
- Used for backend sorting, UI clarity, and COS alignment
