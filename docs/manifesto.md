# Humanficial Design™ Manifesto

This file captures the founding philosophy of Humanficial Design™ — not as a product, but as a philosophy, a category, and a global infrastructure.

We believe that only what is consciously designed will survive the evolving-intelligence age.

This is not documentation.
This is design in written form.
